# Detecting-Phishing-Websites
The project involves a detailed analysis of several machine learning algorithms in order to assets best feature performance, optimize predictive accuracy and increase performance prediction of phishing website decetion model.
This file contains codes to build robust binary classification model for distinguishing phishing websites from legitimate ones. 
The following are the key stages of the project,
  Data preprocessing
  Feature engineering
  Model building and evaluation
